# LEDs
This is the repository for all of the LED Arduino Programs.

Currently working on adding documentation to all of the projects in here.
For documentation of the usage of FastLED itself, head over to http://fastled.io/, you need to download and include their library in the skect in order for these projects to properly compile.
