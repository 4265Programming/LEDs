# LEDs
This is the repository for all of the LED Arduino Programs used by FRC Team 4265.

Currently working on adding documentation to all of the projects in the repository.

For documentation of the usage of FastLED itself, head over to http://fastled.io/. The FastLED library is required in the sketch in order for these projects to properly compile.

The protothread branch is an experimental branch to attempt to use the protothread libraries for multiple LED functions simultaneously. You can find protothread article and download at http://goo.gl/YVuDyw. It is recommended that you do not use this branch yet, as it is not functional there is not much that is changed in it. Feel free to mess with it if you'd like.
