# LEDs
This is the repository for all of the LED Arduino Programs used by FRC Team 4265.

Currently working on adding documentation to all of the projects in here.

For documentation of the usage of FastLED itself, head over to http://fastled.io/. FastLED is required in the sketch in order for these projects to properly compile.

The protothread branch is an experimental brach to attempt to use the protothread libraries for multiple LED functions simultaneously. You can find protothread article and download at http://goo.gl/YVuDyw.
